 A `HRSIndexPathMapperNode` represents a node in a tree of index paths that
 contains a condition and/or child nodes for a specific index in that index path.
 
 If a node does not have a child, it always has a condition, otherwise it is
 automatically removed by its parent.
 
 @note A mapper node evaluates the conditions of its children, not the condition
       of itself! This approach ensures we always have a single root node for
       all conditions that are attached to a mapper that can never be deleted
       and is never be evaluated by itself.
