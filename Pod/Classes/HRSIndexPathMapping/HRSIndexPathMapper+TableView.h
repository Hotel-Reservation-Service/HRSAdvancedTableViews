/**
 The `TableView` category of the `HRSIndexPathMapper` contains a couple of
 convenience methods that can be used when dealing with table views.
 
 They are all mapping directly to one of the standard index path methods but are
 easier to use and easier to read in the context of a table view. You can use
 them side by side with the regular methods.
 
 In the context of a table view, the static space is your data source where the
 dynamic space represents the state of the table view.

 Sets a block condition for the given section while overwriting possible
 previous conditions.
 
 This is a convenience method for working with `UITableView`s. You use this
 method when controlling a complete section. If the condition returns `NO`, the
 complete section is not visible inside the table view.
 
 This behavior is different from adding an appropriate condition to each row for
 a section, where the section is still visible but has no visible rows. In the
 first case, a possible table section header or footer title is not visible,
 whereas in the second case, the titles remain visible with no cell between them.
