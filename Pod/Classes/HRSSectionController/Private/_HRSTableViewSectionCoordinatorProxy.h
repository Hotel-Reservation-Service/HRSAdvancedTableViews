/**
 A table view section coordinator proxy is responsible for mapping values
 between a section controller and the corresponding table view based on the
 mapping information from the controller's section coordinator.
 
 A proxy has a defined direction. It either maps from a table view to a section
 controller or in the other direction, but not both. You can easily create a
 reverse proxy by calling `reverseProxy`.
 
 Mapping is done based on the parameter and the data type this parameter has.
 When mapping index paths, integers (sections) or index sets they are mapped
 based on the information of the section controller's coordinator. When mapping
 data types like a table view, they are mapped by creating a proxy for the
 parameter that has the reverse order than the current proxy.
 
 A proxy automatically has a reverse behaviour when mapping a return value. E.g.
 when you are mapping the table view delegate method
 `tableView:willSelectRowAtIndexPath:` you need a proxy that maps from the table
 view to the section controller. This means the first and second argument are
 mapped to the section controller's space. When you then return an index path
 inside this method, the return value is automatically mapped back to the table
 view from the section controller.
