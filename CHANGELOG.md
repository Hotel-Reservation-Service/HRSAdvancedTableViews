#Changelog

The versioning in this project is based on [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## v0.2.1
- Fix an issue where passing nil as the index path to `dynamicIndexPathForStaticIndexPath:` or `staticIndexPathForDynamicIndexPath:` returned an index path instead of `nil`.
- Fix an issue where calling `setSectionController:` more than once with the same instance of a section controller resulted in the section controller's coordinator becoming `nil`.

## v0.2.0
Add `NSPredicate` support for the HRS Index Path Mapping module. You can now easily specify conditions based on `NSPredicate`.

## v0.1.1
